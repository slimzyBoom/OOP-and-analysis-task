## Title of the System: **LectureSync**

### **What the System Does**

LectureSync is a student-lecturer communication and coordination platform designed to streamline the flow of information regarding lecture schedules, announcements, and course materials. It enables lecturers to update schedules, share materials, and make announcements, while students receive timely notifications and access resources in a centralized manner. By integrating partially with the school's database for authentication and basic data retrieval, the system ensures that only verified users interact within the platform.
